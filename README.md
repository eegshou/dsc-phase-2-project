# Phase 2 Project


## Project Overview

This project analyzes house sales data in a northwestern county using regression model.


## Business Problem

After buiding the regression model, the features that are closely related to house price will be identified. 

Therefore, some suggestions could be given to both the buyers and sellers.

* For the buyer, they will know the price of the house based on the characteristics of the house, and also, what's the investment value for the house.

* For the seller, they may know whether they can do something to sell the house with a better price.


## Data

This project uses the King County House Sales dataset, which can be found in  `kc_house_data.csv` in the data folder in this repo. 
The description of the column names can be found in `column_names.md` in the same folder.




## Methods
### Importing necessary libraries

```python
# import necessary libraries
# Warning off
import warnings
warnings.filterwarnings('ignore')

# import pandas and numpy
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np

# import data visualization
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns
sns.set_style('darkgrid')
%matplotlib inline

# import linear regression related modules
from statsmodels.formula.api import ols
from statsmodels.stats.outliers_influence import variance_inflation_factor
import statsmodels.api as sm
import scipy.stats as stats
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
```


###  Loading data to check the potential features


#loading kc_house_data.csv data

df = pd.read_csv('./data/kc_house_data.csv')
df.head() # checking the head for information

### 2. Data Preparation
#Deal with data types: sqft_basement & date
#sqft_basement: Numerical Data Stored as Strings need to be reformat to float
print(df.sqft_basement.unique())
df.sqft_basement.value_counts()
#there is '?' in the sqft_basement, need to be replaced as nan before reformat to float
df.sqft_basement = df.sqft_basement.map(lambda x: float(x.replace('?', 'nan')))
df.sqft_basement.unique()

## Results

Start on this project by forking and cloning [this project repository](https://github.com/learn-co-curriculum/dsc-phase-2-project) to get a local copy of the dataset.

We recommend structuring your project repository similar to the structure in [the Phase 1 Project Template](https://github.com/learn-co-curriculum/dsc-project-template). You can do this either by creating a new fork of that repository to work in or by building a new repository from scratch that mimics that structure.

## Project Submission and Review

Review the "Project Submission & Review" page in the "Milestones Instructions" topic to learn how to submit your project and how it will be reviewed. Your project must pass review for you to progress to the next Phase.

## Summary

This project will give you a valuable opportunity to develop your data science skills using real-world data. The end-of-phase projects are a critical part of the program because they give you a chance to bring together all the skills you've learned, apply them to realistic projects for a business stakeholder, practice communication skills, and get feedback to help you improve. You've got this!
